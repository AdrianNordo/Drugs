      <div class="text"> <h1>Drugs and Substance abuse in general</h1>
        <p>Even though itâ€™s not legal in Norway to use drugs or sell, somehow people manage to get their hand on the drugs. This is due to the illegal drug dealers or smagler, and this lets people access the drug so easily.  

            If drugs are accessible so easily it will open the door for the new users and this will increase the numbers of the drug users. If the largest number of the society uses drugs it can cause vaital damge to societies especially to the young users.  
            <br><br><h1>Addiction </h1>Addiction is a beast if you lose control over your addiction it can eat you up mentaly and physically. This can turn your life upside down because you will start to take care of your addiction before everything. The fact that  you are well aware that this can cost your life you prefer to ignore it and treat your addiction. </p>
