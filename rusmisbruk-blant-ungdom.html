            The biggest worry and problem with drugs is the use by young people. In Norway 2015 it was reported that around 6% of teens between 15-16 years have tried Cannabis at least one time. The most common and widespread drug used by Norwegian teenagers is “Cannabis”. Also often called “marihuana”, “weed”, “hash” or “pot”. 
            
             Compared with other countries in the European school survey, Norway has in all survey years been among the countries with the lowest proportions of reported cannabis use.

As you grow up, you run into many different people and groups. Some will help you find a healthy way of living and some will try to take advantage of you. But when you meet people that want you to try drugs, it can be hard to give them a straight no. But here I will try to help you find some ways to avoid it.
            Imagine you have not met these people yet, you know they do some drugs, so you're not really sure what you will get into if you start hanging. They might leave you alone when it comes to drugs or they might want you to try. Even though these people could not try to give you drugs, they are still in a bad community that probably won't be healthy to get into. So if you have a bad feeling about someone or you think they could hurt you or someone around you in the long run, try to stay away from them and get friends with healthy lifestyles
